**On the Job:**  
I really enjoy the balance between creating solid software and keeping the project rolling. A good plan ties these together, and I'm always on the hunt for the best way to get things done. The real deal? The team. When they succeed, the whole project picks up speed, and I put in the effort to ensure we gel well and work smoothly together.

**A Bit About Me:**  
I like to stay positive and talk openly with others. I believe in not just doing the coding right but also treating people right â€“ by talking clearly, listening, and showing respect in every talk we have. Plus, I love to keep people laughing. A good laugh makes any day better!
