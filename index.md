I usually call myself as a so(u)rcerer, and using the right tools with the right knowledge I can magically transform a bunch of letters and numbers in something that ~~could~~ work in a computer.
At the moment working for [Farfetch](https://farfetchcareers.com) as a software engineer and as open-source community manager building an open-source program office (aka OSPO).
