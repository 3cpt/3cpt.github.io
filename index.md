**On the Job:**  
I really like finding the balance between doing great work on software and moving the project along. A good plan is important, and I'm always looking for the best way to do things. The most important part? The team. When they do well, the whole project does well, and I work hard to make sure we all get along and work well together.

**A Bit About Me:**  
I like to stay positive and talk openly with others. I believe in not just doing the coding right but also treating people right â€“ by talking clearly, listening, and showing respect in every talk we have. Plus, I love to keep people laughing. A good laugh makes any day better!
